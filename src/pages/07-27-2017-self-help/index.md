_A couple months ago, I was thrown into an abyss. A bad storm.
My memories are blurry as I try to recollect the past few months.
All I know is that at some point in time, I became obsessed with
self-improvement, dead set on sculpting the strongest version of myself.
I still have a long way to go, but so far, here is an overview of what I have
learned through research and experience._

DISCLAIMER: I'm not an expert. I'm not a doctor or anything.
**I'm just sharing what works for _me_.** Also, if you're looking for a comprehensive,
deep dive into these topics, this is not for you. I'm just providing quick summaries
of these topics.

Let's get right into it.

### Cold Showers
**Do you have trouble waking up in the morning?**

Cold showers wake you up.

**Do you want to improve your mental toughness?**

Cold showers train your mental toughness.

**Do you want to burn energy?**

Cold showers activate Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) aka brown fat to burn energy.
Its main function is to use food to generate body heat. It is located around your collar bones,
sternum, neck, and upper back. Brown fat is activated in response to cold temperatures.
When brown fat is activated, it generates heat by burning adipose aka white fat.
White fat is what you get from eating junk food, it's a bad kind of fat.
 **Basically, brown fat burns white fat when you are taking a cold shower.**

**Do you feel sore after that killer workout you recently did?**

Cold showers reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).

Hop into the shower, turn the cold water all the way, and embrace the pain of
freezing liquid drenching your naked body. Endure it. Get used to it.
Be consistent. Otherwise, there's no point.
