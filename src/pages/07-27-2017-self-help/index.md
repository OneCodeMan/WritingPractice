_A couple months ago, I was thrown into an abyss. A bad storm.
My memories are blurry as I try to recollect the past few months.
All I know is that at some point in time, I became obsessed with
self-improvement, dead set on sculpting the strongest version of myself.
I still have a long way to go, but so far, here is an overview of what I have
learned through research and experience._

DISCLAIMER: I'm not an expert. I'm not a doctor or anything.
**I'm just sharing what works for _me_.** Also, if you're looking for a comprehensive,
deep dive into these topics, this is not for you. I'm just providing quick summaries
of these topics.

Let's get right into it.

### Cold Showers
**Do you have trouble waking up in the morning?**

Cold showers wake you up. When cold water hits you, you instinctively react
by breathing heavier. Breathing heavier increases oxygen intake and speeds up
blood circulation. Blood travels around your body faster, giving your brain a
little energy boost.

**Do you want to burn energy?**

Cold showers activate Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) aka brown fat to burn energy.
Its main function is to use food to generate body heat. It is located around your collar bones,
sternum, neck, and upper back. Brown fat is activated in response to cold temperatures.
When brown fat is activated, it generates heat by burning adipose aka white fat.
White fat is what you get from eating junk food, it's a bad kind of fat.
 **Basically, brown fat burns white fat when you are taking a cold shower.**

**Do you feel sore after that killer workout you recently did?**

Cold showers reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). DOMS is that crazy
soreness you feel after a workout. It is due to mechanical damage to the muscles
and inflammation. Cold showers are believed to reduce the inflammation.
From my experience, I do feel significantly less sore after a cold shower.
But I have to admit, the relation between DOMS and cold showers is something
I currently lack knowledge in.

**Do you want to improve your mental toughness?**

Cold showers train your mental toughness.
From my experience, I have learned persistence and endurance through cold showers.
Cold showers have so many benefits, and they are the rational thing to be doing.
It's painful, it's uncomfortable, but it's the right action to take.
Keeping that in mind, it has taught me to choose doing the right thing over
doing the comfortable thing.

Hop into the shower, turn the cold water all the way, and embrace the pain of
freezing liquid drenching your naked body. Endure it. Get used to it.
**Be consistent! Otherwise, there's no point.**

There are a lot more benefits to taking cold showers, but these are the reasons
why _I_ do them.

### Black Coffee
Do you have trouble waking up in the morning?

Black coffee increases your energy levels. Caffeine blocks Adenosine, a neurotransmitter
that promotes sleep. Other neurotransmitters (like dopamine) increase and lead to
enhanced firing of neurons.

Caffeine has tons of other benefits... But that's the only reason _I_ drink it.
