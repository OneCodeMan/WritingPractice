_A couple months ago, I was thrown into an abyss. A bad storm.
My memories are blurry as I try to recollect the past few months.
All I know is that at some point in time, I became obsessed with
self-improvement. I still have a long way to go, but here is what I have
learned so far._

DISCLAIMER: I'm not an expert. I'm not a doctor or anything.
**I'm just sharing what works for _me_.**

Let's get started!

### Cold Showers
Do you have trouble waking up in the morning?
Cold showers wake you up.
Do you want to improve your mental toughness?
Cold showers train your mental toughness.
Do you want to burn fat?
Cold showers burn Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) aka brown fat.
Do you feel sore after that killer workout you recently did?
Cold showers reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).

Hop into the shower, turn the cold water all the way, and embrace the pain of
freezing liquid drenching your naked body. Endure it. Get used to it.
Be consistent. Otherwise, there's no point.
