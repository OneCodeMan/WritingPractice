_I'm completely new to creative writing so this probably sucks but I enjoyed writing it!_



It was Jackson's last day at his software job. On paydays after work, while employees made
their way to the bar, Jackson made his way to the parking lot.
Today, before he clocked out, he took one of the notebooks from the supply cabinet
and left the building as if it were a normal work day.

The office was always freezing cold, but outdoors was always scorching hot.
Jackson wore a longsleeve while coding in the office. Outside, he took his pale,
baggy longsleeve off. His eyes slightly widened after he noticed the price tag still
attached. He let out a half-sigh half-chuckle, and continued walking to his car.
The dark tank top he wore underneath appeared to suffocate his belly.
He didn't have to check that for a price tag. The label at the back of that tank top
was slowly fading, the _Size M_ barely readable.

He drove back to his apartment.

Empty styrofoam containers that smelt like Chinese takeout filled the garbage bin.
Years back, it was seran wrap with little pieces of kale, quinoa, and cilantro stuck to it.

Fancy TV, an olive-green worn-out sofa, and a wide rectangular table filled the living room.
Years back, it was family, friends, laughter, and fitness equipment.

Empty vodka bottles, ziplock bags of half-eaten mushrooms, empty bags of _Lays_ original
chips filled the table in front of the TV.
Years back, they were filled with self-help and philosophy books.
The only items that were filled on that table were two cylindrical orange containers labeled
```
WALLACE, JACKSON
TAKE 2 CAPSULES BY MOUTH ONCE DAILY
FLUOXETINE 20MG
```

They were left unopened. And another two labeled

```
WALLACE, JACKSON
TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH BEFORE BEDTIME
QUETIAPINE 25MG
```

Half full.

He sat on the couch in a slouched posture and turned the TV on. Brushing the _Lays_ bags off the table, Jackson
placed the notebook in front of him and navigated the remote control, leaving the notebook
unopened. His Netflix queue was empty. A few months back, it was flooded with TV shows, movies
documentaries, everything.

Jackson looked through his Steam games. All of them were finished. He then
browsed games on the website, but put his laptop away after a few minutes.

Jackson checked his fridge. No food. He then closes it and heads out, bringing only his notebook and a pen.

He made his way to the apartment roof.

He placed his notebook on the ledge of the roof, and wrote:

```
Don't feel bad for me. I wanted this.
```

His eyes gazed over that sentence over and over, the more he read it, the more frequent he nodded.

He closed the notebook, and stared down from the roof.
He thought about nothing in particular.
Waiting for his mind to turn off.
Waiting for his natural body to forget the fear of heights.

"This is the best option." He whispered to himself.

He put his right hand on the ledge, starts tip toeing to bring himself up the ledge,
hypnotized by his feelings.

But the sound of a squeak brought his mind back to earth. The sound came from behind.
A woman entered the roof. She was carrying a lighter and a cigarette. She noticed Jackson.

"Hey." she says. "You come here often?"
