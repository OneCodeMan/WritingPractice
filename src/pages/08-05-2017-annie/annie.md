1.

So this is my 8<sup>th</sup> life.
Through each life, I don't remember much during my early years.
My memory of this life starts at Sadaharu's Pet Store.
That's where Annie picked me up.

A woman wearing an imperial, violet one-piece walked up in front of my cage.
Her long, dark-brown hair disguised as a ponytail.
"That one is _KEYY-OUTE_, I'll take him. Wait, is it a him or a her?"

"It's a him." the store owner says, kinda bothered. He must really enjoy working here.

"What should I name him?" she asks, pondering with her thumb and index finger holding her chin.

"I really don't know..." the store owner says with a heavy sigh.
"He's a huge dog with white fur and brown eyes.. maybe _Moro_?"

"Like that wolf from Princess Mononoke? But _Moro_ is a female.." she rebuttles.
"And this one doesn't look like a grumpy creature.. And she dies in that movie.."

"Okay, fair point." the store owner looks to the side, puckering his lips.
"How about.. _Xander_? That's a pretty badass name." he says, suggestively.

"How about _Lexus: Last White Beast Dog God of The Century_?" she says, excitedly.

"I think you should just stick with _Xander_."

She brings me to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor of a cheap apartment.
"Alrighty, Xander. Here's your home!" she swings her arms towards the room as if
she was a host introducing the next performance of a talent show.

She crouches down to my level and rubs my head, with a big smile.
"I'm just gonna settle, and then I'll feed you some treats!"

3.

A door creaks open, and footsteps gradually become louder in my direction.
She shows up, wearing a gray longsleeve and royal blue pajamas, the Pillsbury Dough guy
drawn on them. Her hair running down past her shoulders.
"You must be hungry, eh, Xander? Time to eat!"
She places two stainless steel bowls in front of me.
One full of water. The other full of brown dog treats in the shape of bones.

Those hazel green eyes stare at me as I lick the bowl full of water.

"I guess it's a good time to tell you a bit about myself, Xander."
I shift my attention towards her as she sits cross-legged in front of me, making herself comfortable.
"I'm Annie. I'm a barista on weekends, and a baker on weekdays. I don't really
enjoy those things... What I do enjoy is chemistry! I'm saving up to go to college
for that."

She pauses for a moment. I take a bite of a dog treat.

"I find it fascinating, chemistry. Transformation. Taking plain elements and..
mixing them with other elements in a controlled environment and.. creating something
beautiful." she giggles. "I don't know about dogs, but that kind of relates to being
human. If you immerse yourself with the right combination of people, places, events,
and things, you could transform into something beautiful." she says, with a deep smile.

"I also like getting lost in good books.. playing Stardew Valley, Nuclear Throne.. hmm..
and sleeping."

She sighs.

"You probably have no idea what i'm saying, eh?" She laughs.
"I don't blame ya'. You're just a dog.
The sad thing is that even other humans can't understand me.
At least you're willing to listen, Xander. Well, that's what it feels like."

She pauses again for a moment. This time longer. Looking down on the floor. Spaced out.
Lost in her thoughts. She seems like a caring human.

"Oh, I also LOOOVE mustard. You must be tired of eating plain dog treats all the time. One sec."
She makes her way to the kitchen, and then comes out holding a yellow plastic bottle.

"Mustard is a universal condiment that works well on anything and everything. Rice,
coffee, peanuts, parfaits, ice cream, eggs.. Drench mustard on that and it'll taste even better!"

She squeezes the mustard bottle, coating the dog treat bowl with yellow liquid,
so much that the treats themselves could barely be seen.
She seems like a fucking psychopath.

"Go on, eat it!" she insisted.

It wasn't a good night for me.
