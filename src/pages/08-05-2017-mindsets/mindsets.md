Do you lack motivation? Discipline? Looking for a solid way of thinking?
Here are some mindset suggestions that could work for you.

**DISCLAIMER**: I'm not a life coach, an expert, or whatever. I'm still a growing
human. I'm just sharing what works for me.

# Opposite Mindset
Whenever you have thoughts of weakness and/or laziness, do the complete opposite
of what you feel like doing.

Do you feel like skipping that leg workout? <br />
Tell yourself "Fuck that. I'm not gonna skip this workout. I'm gonna
squat even harder."

Do you feel like giving in to that slice of meat lovers pizza? <br />
Tell yourself "Fuck that. I'm gonna diet even harder."

This way, you'll condition yourself to become even stronger whenever
those weak thoughts arrive.

# Future Pleasure Mindset
Before you do something you really don't want to do, think about how satisfying
it'll be in the future and do it for the sake of that.

When you're about to take your daily cold shower and you really don't want to,
tell yourself that in one minute, this will all be over and you'll feel good.

When you're about to do your HIIT workout and you are having second thoughts,
tell yourself that you'll be dying in the next few minutes, but you'll be in
bed later that night, satisfied that you went through with it.

This way, you'll condition yourself to acknowledge necessary pain for
future pleasure. You will welcome the pain that makes you grow.

# Rational Mindset (personal favorite)
Do what is rational. <br />
You can either do what feels good, or you can do what is right.

Every situation you get into, especially the bad ones, don't let your emotions
rule over you. Let your rational mind take over.

Feelings are inevitable.<br />
We can't control our emotions, but we can control our actions.

A wise person once told me,
> _Don't focus on the pain of doing it, focus on doing it properly._

Don't focus on the pain of those plank pushups, those sprints. Rather,
focus on doing those exercises with proper form.

> _“Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.”_ - Marcus Aurelius

# Strongest Self Mindset
Whenever you don't know how to act in a situation, ask yourself: <br />
>_What would the strongest version of my self do?_

Now, who _is_ your strongest self? <br />
You'd have to know: <br />
1. What kind of person you want to be, what your goals are.
2. What you can do to be that person.
3. Do it.

Don't fake it. Be it.

This way, you'll condition yourself to choose the best option in tough situations.

# Someone Else Mindset
Do you not really care about yourself? Do you care about someone else?

Do it for them! <br />
Think about that person whenever you feel weak, and do it for them.

Keep them close to your thoughts throughout your day, the fact that
that person just so happens to exist at the same time as you, despite
how long humans have been around for. Think about how how huge this planet is,
and you just happen to know someone who is so amazing. Isn't that nice?
Doesn't that make your heart all mushy?

Good. Do it for them.

# Self-love Mindset
This is the Someone Else mindset but directed towards yourself.

> _Ever loved someone so much, you would do anything for them? Yeah, well make that
someone yourself and do whatever the hell you want._ - Harvey Specter from Suits

Learn to love yourself. Embrace your strengths. Accept your flaws.

# Nihilist Mindset
Life is meaningless. We all die, anyway. Do whatever you want!

This way, you'll condition yourself to be chill at any situation.

_This could go wrong if misused..._ <br />
_This isn't for everyone..._ <br />
_Seriously._

And that's it. I hope this helps or entertains some of you. Thanks for reading!
